# This is an example configuration that loads the "Kitchen" scene from the
# local MoveIt warehouse and benchmarks the "manipulator" group in the Pick1
# query using the Start1 initial state (all pre-stored in the local warehouse)

# Three different planners from OMPL are run a total of 50 times each, with a
# maximum of 10 seconds per run.  Output is stored in the /home/benchmarks directory.
